# UFOs

## Overview
This webpage was created to show UFOs that have been spotted in the sky. Dana wanted to build a filtered table to help people see where and when UFOs have been spotted.

## Results
The table can be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape, depending on what the user would like to look for. Simply type the criteria into the corresponding box and the table automatically filters itself based on the provided input.

## Summary
There is only 13 days of data provided in the table. Because of this, the website is extremely limited in its usefulness. I would recommend adding more data from more dates and more countries, as well as cleaning up the data in the table to make it look more presentable to the end user.
